The IEEE 2018 World Congress on Services held in San Francisco, CA during 2-7 July was a jamboree of sorts. It included the BigData Congress as well as Cloud, Edge, ICCC (Cognitive Computing), ICIOT (Internet of Things), ICWS (Web Services) and SCC (Services Computing) parallel sessions. I was privileged to present a work-in-progress paper related to personalization of travel recommendations using social media analysis in one of the BigData sessions. The basic idea is to mine a user's social media content (like twitter) and use that data to predict the user's places of interest categories (like museum, parks, restaurants, buildings, etc.) in the travel domain. This personalized recommendation assists the user in planning 

Dr Raj Reddy (Carnegie Mellon University) delivered the first keynote and spoke on ‘Impact of AI on Services Industry’. The services industry comprises tasks that are human intensive, involve product development, or are services themselves like [X]aaS. AI can be help these with continuous monitoring, anomaly detection  

Dr Reddy was quick to point out that AI was not created to replace humans. Though the media has created hype regarding AI with terms like “deep learning” and “neural networks” commonplace, the fact remains that AI has given us possibilities to do things we couldn’t do,  

Hype
 AI was not created to replace humans
 Tech has given possibilities to do things we couldn't do.
 Deep learning is just pattern recognition method
 Any revolution leads to loss of jobs...we need to have policies that handle it (political issue not tech issue)
 AI Stanford composing music, painting
 AI is fallible (2010 flash crash of stock market)
 Duality of ai: search compensates for lack of knowledge and knowledge compensates for lack of search
 Traditional knowledge from school and search (heuristics) from people.
 Data driven knowledge 
 Paradigms in science: experiment, theory, simulation, data driven science
 Data from big data, multiple media, crowd intelligence, ...(china wants to learn from)
 Language translation (google), intelligent assistant (alexa), autonomous vehicles
 AI is merely a toolkit. Paradigm of AI is sense-think-act
 Engg enhances physical capabilities, computing and AI enhances mental capabilities 
 Knowledge age KaaS  

This was my second visit to San Francisco and therefore I was not over-excited about seeing the sights. I did get to see a part of the city that I had not explored earlier: the Tenderloin area. What strikes anyone walking through the streets in this section is the homelessness that stares you in the face. I stayed at a modest hotel which was a 15-minute walk from the conference venue
