Facebook is in the news for all the wrong reasons these days<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. And at the center of their troubles is the often discussed issue of privacy. Digital technology has evolved from being merely computing machines to connected machines. First it was the Intranet that connected computers togethers in a local space. Then came the Internet bringing with it global connectivity. Communication became easier, faster and more convenient. Benefits of this new technology began to flow from the workspace to the personal space of individuals. A new way of communicating began to emerge. Social media platforms began to take shape. And people embraced it with joy. Today's Internet of Things (IoT) is taking this connectedness to a whole new level!

It was no longer merely about messaging. The Internet technology allowed for sharing pictures, videos, audio clips. It was no longer necessary to visit people to see them. Once could login to the platform and make a video call or start a chat session. It all looked so useful and helpful in building friendships and strengthening familial bonds. This connectedness drew people into discovering new ways of "staying in touch". Sharing of moments like photo albums and retelling of stories which were done in a specific place with real people around are now done in a virtual space with multiple copies floating around, posted, liked and shared. 

Social media platforms have helped in connecting people and enabling relationships. But it would be naïve to believe that these platforms have the user's interests in mind. It is only when one digs deeper that one realizes that all the data provided by the user is being used to rake in profits through selling advertisements, etc. The more time a user spends on the platform the better for the company. Addiction to social media platforms is a real problem which not many people want to accept or talk about. 

It is important to cultivate a balanced use of technology. Digital space cannot be a substitute for real encounters with people. And one must always keep in mind that whatever is put on a digital platform is like throwing feathers in the wind. Throwing is easy. But if one has to collect them back, well, that can be a nightmare!
