#### MSASPCP: Media Sentiment Augmented Stock Price Change Predictor

**Introduction**

The stock market is a major indicator of the economy both nationally and internationally. Pricing of stocks depends on a variety of factor, the primary one being investor confidence. Being able to predict the direction of the stock enables smart investing as well as tones down the unpredictableness of the market. 

**Significance**

The stock market has a big impact on oridinary people. Most of the retirees in America have invested in stocks to be able to live out their years. When stock prices fall they lose not only their earnings but also their peace of mind. It is important to be able to predict with sufficient accuracy the changes that might occur in stock prices. Measuring investor confidence is not easy. 

**Forward Thinking**

The first method we adopted was to use stocktwits as a means to predict change (bullish or bearish). To this model we augmented sentiment scores from news articles references in the Twits.
